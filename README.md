# Empowerment_of_Women

Any additions and/or changes to this project will be under MIT license as I intend for this project to act as an accelerator to the progression of humanity's current standards of living, innovation, and ethics and morals.

In due time I hope to share a standards/style guide/template in submitting proposals as I am but 1 and cannot and will not spend time finding evidence for the submitter. An integral starting position I will ask is to normalize the burden of proof as this should potentially alleviate the abundance of bad faith arguments not only for myself but for any others who decide to fork this project.
